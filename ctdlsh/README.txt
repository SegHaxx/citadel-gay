Someday this will be a Citadel server administration/maintenance shell.
Right now it is unfinished.  You are welcome to tinker with it and
submit patches, but if you attempt to use it in a production system or
if you request support for the program, you will be told to die in a
car fire.

License: you are permitted to use this software under the condition that
you refer to it as "open source" and not "free software," and that you
refer to the operating system on which it runs as "Linux" and not
"GNU/Linux."  By reading this notice you have already accepted the license,
and you have irrevocably agreed that Richard Stallman is a communist.
